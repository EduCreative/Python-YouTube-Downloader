## Overview
This is a Youtube Video downloader using two libraries pytube, and tkinter.

## The challenge

- My first challange is to import pytube and download a video using simple and few lines of code.
- After it is working add GUI elements like window, text input, and download button.
- Then I will go and add more functions like progress bar, file types, etc.

Users should be able to:

- Download Youtube video using video URL.
-

## My process
For this project, I am using different resources like W3school, stackoverflow, Youtube tutorials, documentations, etc. And covering all aspects of project step by step.
- I want a simple CLI based video downloader (in main2.py)
- Add GUI elements like window, text input, and download button. (in main1.py)
- Then I will go and add more functions like progress bar, file types, etc. (in main.py)


### Library installations
- pip install tkinter
- pip install customtkinter==0.3
- pip install pytube

## Built with
### Languages
- PYTHON
  
### Libraries:
- tkinter
- pytube

## What I learned

- I learned that I need to learn more by making more similar projects because I have not made any resonable (and useable) project in Python yet.
- GUI using tkinter, from forms to buttons and everything in between.
- Use github along with VSCode for a full fledge project.

## Continued development
I need to practice Python by making more practical projects. And after completing this one I will go for more advance projects.

## Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me for every thing as I use W3School as a reference tool.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped me to seek help for different libraries and functions.
